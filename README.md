# Milestone 2: Short Project Statement

Your team is submitting a statement of *intent*, not a specification - it is natural that your plans will change somewhat as you refine your ideas. The key is to find some domain and task(s) that both interests you and presents an opportunity for infovis. That is, there is some task where a human needs to understand the structure of a large dataset. You are definitely welcome to link the infovis project to another class or research project. You may also build on existing software, but your project should include some implementation work of your own. This project should be completed in d3. Think of this as working through the 'what' and 'why' questions. The 'how' comes later.

Statement format: your writeup should be 800-1200 words and follow this outline for major sections:

## Project Title and Team:
Include names and email addresses of all people on this project team.

## Domain and Data:
* a brief description of the domain - what is it, and why do people care about it?
* a description and link to the dataset. What type of dataset is it? What are the items and attributes? How big is it (number of items and attributes)? Do you have it in hand already, and if not, why not?

## Tasks:
* 4-5 possible user stories. Try to be specific! A definition from Mike Cohn<sup>1</sup>:
> User stories are short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template: "As a `<type of user>`, I want `<some goal>` so that `<some reason>`."
* For each user story, write an abstract task that most closely fits. [Tamara Munzner](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/) defines the language of *action-target pairs*. Action-target pairs are phrases that describe an *action* (e.g., 'discover', 'identify', 'compare') paired with the object or *target* of that action (e.g., 'trends', 'outliers', 'shape') -- combined, we get action-target pairs (e.g., 'discover trends', 'identify outliers', 'compare shape'). Think about describing your tasks in this way.

## Iteration Documentation:
User stories are often written on index cards or sticky notes, stored in a shoe box, and arranged on walls or tables to facilitate planning and discussion. As such, they strongly shift the focus from writing about features to discussing them. In fact, these discussions are more important than whatever text is written. Include a captioned figure showing how your team has iterated on your user stories - it can be a picture of a whiteboard with some early ideas, a table with index cards, or a wall with sticky notes. Document your process with a photo from at least one in-person or virtual meeting in a collaborative workspace with your team.

## Previous Work:
While this section will not be as complete as in your design document, you should begin to discuss what has been done in this area. Find at least 3 significant projects or papers and describe how they are relevant to your topic. Your bibliography can include both academic work and any relevant commercial tools. Feel free to include relevant examples from the in-class research presentations. You do not have to go into great detail here, just make it clear that you have looked around and started to get a lay of the land for what has been done before.

**One statement per project team is due as a push (not just a commit) to github. Submissions should be in pdf, txt, or markdown (md).**
